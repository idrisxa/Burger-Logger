# Burger-Logger

Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. The burger logger uses MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger in the list of burgers not devoured -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the list of devoured burgers.

The deployed app is accessible at, https://warm-plains-66976.herokuapp.com
